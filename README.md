## Intro to Optimization for Roboticists and Computer Scientists

The tutorial is aimed at computer science audiences who are a bit unfamiliar with Optimization Techniques. 

Some of the popular concepts that we touch upon are as follows: 
1. Gradient Descent​
2. Steepest Descent​
3. Newton's Method​
4. Quasi-Newton Methods (like BFGS)​
5. Line Search ​
6. Adam​
7. RMSprop​
8. Trust Region
9. Interior Point Methods​ (Linear/Quadratic Programming)​
10. Simplex Method​
11. Branch and Bound & Branch and Cut​
12. Barrier Function​
13. Non-convex optimization​
14. Constrained optimization​
15. Gradient free optimization​
16. Backpropagation
